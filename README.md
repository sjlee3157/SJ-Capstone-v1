# SJ-Capstone-v1
US Mass Incarceration Graph Tower (Unity FPS data visualization game)

Data scraped from http://www.prisonstudies.org.
https://github.com/sjlee3157/prison-data-scraper

~~**Spoilers!**~~

The graph represents the US prison rate, 1980-2016.
The height (y-axis) of the red cloud represents the highest global prison rate (besides the US) in the year of the player's current position on the graph.
The red boxes are emitted onto the ramp at the height of the cloud.
